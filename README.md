📂 Assignment Submission Guidelines

Welcome to the `assignment` branch! Please follow the structure and naming conventions carefully when submitting your assignments.

---

📁 Directory Structure

Each student must create a **new directory** named after the **Assignment ID**.

✅ Example:ESMatromonial


MM011/ ├── backend/ │   └── [All backend code, scripts, databases] ├── frontend/ │   └── [All frontend code, UI assets, styling, etc.] ├── documentation.pdf ├── presentation.pptx

📌 Guidelines

1. Directory Naming:
   - Name your main folder as per the assignment ID (e.g., `MM011`).

2. Backend & Frontend:
   - Create two subfolders:  
     - `backend/` → for all server-side scripts, APIs, databases, etc.  
     - `frontend/` → for all client-side code like HTML, CSS, JS, React/Vue, etc.

3. *nclude Docs & Presentation:
   - Add a `documentation.pdf` explaining the project architecture, flow, and key components.
   - Add a `presentation.pptx` summarizing the assignment for review.

🚫 Do Not

- Do not push to the root directory of the branch.
- Do **not** use names like `my_project`, `final_assignment`, etc. Use the correct ID like `MM011`.

✅ Good to Go?

Once your directory is properly structured and all contents are in place, commit and push it to this branch.
